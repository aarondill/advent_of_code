# Advent of Code

This is my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.

Due to legal reasons, puzzle text and inputs are not included in this repository. You can find the puzzle text and inputs in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) website.
Each solution will begin with a comment that includes the year and day of the puzzle, as well as the link to the puzzle on the website.

> Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code? Please don't. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.

Each solution is designed to accept solution input from standard input, OR from the file given by the first argument. Each solution outputs its solution to standard output.

## File Structure

Each year is contained in a single directory, with subdirectories for each day of the puzzle.
Within each day directory, there is a single file for each language solution.

## Running

- JavaScript solutions are run with `node`.
- TypeScript solutions are run with `tsx` ([link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx)).
- Java solutions are run with `java`.
- Python solutions are run with `python3`.
